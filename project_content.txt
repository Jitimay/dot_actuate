The 1% Project: Polka-Resilient-Actuator
(Polka-RA)

You have a powerful and unique set of components. We will pivot the "Polka-DePIN-Bot"
concept from a mobile robot fleet to a Decentralized, Resilient, Off-Grid Actuation and
Monitoring System—a project that maximizes the use of your specific hardware and
directly addresses the "Resilient Apps" theme in a way no other team is likely to attempt.
This project, Polka-Resilient-Actuator (Polka-RA), focuses on verifiable, off-grid control,
which is a critical need in regions with unstable infrastructure.

1. The "Woah" Factor: Off-Grid, Verifiable Actuation

The core innovation is using the LilyGO TTGO T-Call ESP32 SIM800L to establish a
resilient, off-grid connection to the Polkadot network via GSM/GPRS. This proves that the
system is truly resilient and not dependent on local Wi-Fi or fiber, which is a major win for
the "Resilient Apps" theme.

Project Name: Polka-Resilient-Actuator (Polka-RA)

Hackathon Track: User-centric Apps / Polkadot Tinkerers (Advanced)
Core Function: A decentralized, on-chain system for remotely controlling and verifying the
execution of physical tasks (e.g., watering, monitoring) in an off-grid environment.

2. Hardware Mapping and Technical Implementation

We will use your available components to build a sophisticated, multi-functional prototype.

A. Polkadot Integration: The Resilient Command Pallet

We will use a custom Substrate Pallet (or a smart contract on a Polkadot Parachain like
Moonbeam) to manage the resilient command flow:
1. Command Submission: A user submits a command (e.g., ActuatePump(duration) ) via a
dApp. This command is stored on-chain.
2. Off-Grid Polling: The LilyGO TTGO T-Call periodically wakes up, connects via GPRS,
and queries the Polkadot chain for new commands addressed to its unique device ID.
3. Verifiable Actuation:
• The device captures a "Pre-Actuation" image hash via the ESP-CAM and sends it to
the chain.
• It executes the command (e.g., turns on the pump via the Relay).

• It captures a "Post-Actuation" image hash and sends it to the chain, along with a

Proof of Actuation (a signed transaction confirming the action was taken).
4. Automated Payment/Reward: The Polkadot chain verifies the Proof of Actuation and
automatically releases a small reward to the device's wallet for completing the task.

B. The "Wow" Factor: Demonstrating Resilience

The key to winning is the narrative around the LilyGO TTGO T-Call.
• Scenario: Demonstrate the system operating in a location with NO Wi-Fi. Show the
GPRS connection status and the successful submission of a transaction to the Polkadot
chain.
• The Proof: The dApp will display the two image hashes (Pre and Post actuation) stored
immutably on the Polkadot chain, proving that the physical action was not only
commanded but verifiably executed in an off-grid, resilient manner.

Potential Impact

Polka-RA's Edge
Highest Score. Requires complex, low-level
programming for the ESP32 SIM800L (GPRS),
integration of multiple microcontrollers
(Mega/Nano), and the use of Rust/Substrate
for the on-chain logic. This is a highly advanced
technical stack.
Perfect Alignment. The use of GPRS/GSM for
off-grid communication is the ultimate
demonstration of a "Resilient App" in a
challenging environment like Burundi.
High. It moves beyond simple data logging to
Decentralized Actuation, using the blockchain
not just for data, but for resilient, verifiable
command and control of physical hardware.
High. The model is immediately applicable to
off-grid infrastructure, remote monitoring, and
automated farming in developing regions,
directly addressing the "radically useful" motto.

4. Action Plan for the Hackathon

1. Phase 1: Resilient Communication (LilyGO)
• Get the LilyGO TTGO T-Call to successfully connect to the internet via GPRS.
• Implement a lightweight Polkadot client (e.g., using a library or raw
HTTP/WebSocket calls) to submit a simple transaction.
2. Phase 2: Verifiable Actuation (Mega/Nano/ESP-CAM)
• Write the firmware to receive a command from the ESP32 and actuate the Pump
and Relay.
• Integrate the ESP-CAM to capture and hash images before and after actuation.
3. Phase 3: Polkadot Pallet & Demo
• Develop the Command-Pallet in Substrate to store the command and verify the
image hashes.
• Create a compelling video that shows the entire loop: On-chain Command -> OffGrid GPRS Transmission -> Physical Actuation -> On-chain Verification (Image
Hashes).
This project is a guaranteed showstopper and perfectly tailored to your unique strengths
and resources.
